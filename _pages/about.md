Fangming Liu received his B.Engr. degree from Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, and his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; from 2009 to 2010, he was a visiting scholar at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Canada; from 2012-2013, he was a StarTrack Visiting Young Faculty in Microsoft Research Asia (微软亚洲研究院“铸星计划”). He is leading the research group of CloudNeXt: "Cloud Datacenter & Green Computing/Communications" (“云数据中心与绿色计算/通信”) to bridge theory and practice, within the following cutting-edge areas of distributed and networking systems:
* Cloud Computing and Infrastructure: Datacenter, Green Computing/Communications, Multi-/Hybrid-/Inter-Clouds, Smart Data-driven/Machine-learning-based Power Monitoring/Management for Energy-efficiency
* Cloud OS and Full-Stack System Virtualization: Software Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Virtual Machine (VM), OpenStack & Container, FPGA & DPDK for Acceleration
* Edge-Cloud Systems and Apps: Edge Computing and Mobile-Cloud, Internet Content Distribution, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Systems, including consumer cloud storage (1-click file hosting and synchronization, a.k.a 网盘云存储), content delivery networks (CDNs), collaborative caching, live video streaming and video-on-demand (VoD)
* Methodologies: Co-design of software/hardware with Open-source running codes (e.g., DHL (dynamic hardware library): an FPGA-CPU co-design framework for accelerating NFV with DPDK), Cross-disciplinary theories and their applications, including Game Theory, Queueing Theory, Control Theory (Lyapunov optimization)
* Real-World Measurements: such as past projects on PlanetLab: Internet Measurement: Topology & Evolution, Measuring and optimizing delays in video conferences
* Motto: applications drive innovation, software defines everything, while hardware changing the future!
